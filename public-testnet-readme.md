# Cosmos-Hub Vega Upgrade Public Testnet Instruction

We are running a public testnet for the vega upragde. All Cosmos Hub validators are invited to participate in the public testnet. In addition, we are providing a few public endpoints for testing integrations.

We are also available on the `#validators-verified` channel in the [Cosmos Developers discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) for support.

## Joining as a validator
You can continue using the same account and validator key as the one you're using for `cosmoshub-4`. If you'd like to request testnet ATOMs for delegation, please make an issue with your account information.
